# Docker compose files

list of docker files that I can use daily

## most of the bd containers works with:

- **username: root**
- **password: root**

## os:

- alpine very intresting maybe watch such wow

## notes for me le dumb

- diff between a docker-compose and a Dockerfile is that docker-compose is for setting up a multiple containers env, while a Dockerfile is when you want to specify the build of a specific image.
